# Real-Time Display System - Deployment Files

## For Browser Testing (Double-Click to Open):

### âœ… **RECOMMENDED: Standalone Version**
- **File**: `complete-standalone.html` (in main directory)
- **File**: `deployment/standalone/index.html` (same file, different location)
- **Size**: ~354KB
- **Usage**: Double-click this file and it will open directly in any browser
- **Benefits**: Everything is embedded, no web server needed

## For Web Server Deployment:

### **Multi-File Version** 
- **Location**: `deployment/multi-file/`
- **Files**: `index.html`, `main-C5PDVNZE.js`, `polyfills-B6TNHZQ6.js`, `styles-5INURTSO.css`, `favicon.ico`
- **Usage**: Upload all files to a web server, then access `index.html`
- **Benefits**: Smaller individual files, better for web deployment

## Quick Start:

1. **For immediate testing**: Double-click `complete-standalone.html`
2. **For web deployment**: Upload contents of `deployment/multi-file/` to your web server

## Note:
The issue you were experiencing was that `ng build` was opening a pager instead of building. Using `npm run build` works correctly and creates the production files in `dist/angular-app/browser/`.
